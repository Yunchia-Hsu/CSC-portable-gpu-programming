## Error Handling

In this exercise you are given a code with errors. SYCL provides mechanisms to catch both synchonous and asynchronous expections. However the behaiviour dependends a lot on the hardware capabilities, runtime and, drivers. 

The SYCL code  has already in place the constructs to catch both synchonous and asynchronous expections. The task is to fix the code using the error messages given by the code.
