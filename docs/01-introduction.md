# Parallel Programming & GPUs {.section}

# Supercomputers 

*High-performance computing (HPC) is the use of supercomputers and<br>computer clusters to solve advanced computation problems.*<br>
âˆ’ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing)

- Supercomputers enable solving computation problems that are too slow to solve on a standard computer
- Application areas are everywhere
  - Climate, weather, and earth sciences
  - Chemistry and material science
  - Particle physics and cosmology
  - Life sciences and medicine
  - Renewable energy and fusion research
  - Engineering
  - Large-scale AI
  - ...

# High Performance Computing through the ages



# Accelerators

- Specialized parallel hardware for compute-intensive operations
    - Co-processors for traditional CPUs
    - Based on highly parallel architectures
    - Graphics processing units (GPU) have been the most common
      accelerators during the last few years
- Promises
    - Very high performance per node
    - More FLOPS/Watt
- Usually major rewrites of programs required



# GPUs @ CSC
